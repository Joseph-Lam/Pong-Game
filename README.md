# Pong Game

A basic pong game using HTML5 Canvas. 

## Technologies Used

##### HTML
##### CSS
##### Javascript with ES2015 

This project was completed after learning about object-oriented programming (OOP), where code is grouped into reusable objects.
The code is encapsulated into a class object so special features such as the constructor can be used. 


## Personal Learning

Using HTML5 canvas for the first time was quite an intense volume of information at first and I definitely needed some time to understand what was happening. With Pong, the positioning and constructing the movements and actions were also challenging, but I'm glad to have tackled this project because I have a much better understanding with Javascript and how versatile it can be.
